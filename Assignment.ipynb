    " An ensemble technique in machine learning is a method that combines the predictions of multiple individual models to improve the accuracy and robustness of the overall prediction. Ensemble methods are often used when a single model may not be sufficient to accurately capture the complexity of the data or when multiple models with different strengths and weaknesses are available.\n",
    "\n",
    " There are several types of ensemble methods, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bagging: This method involves training multiple instances of the same model on different subsets of the training data and then combining the predictions of each model. Bagging can improve model stability and reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Boosting: This method involves iteratively training a sequence of weak models, with each model focusing on the examples that were misclassified by the previous model. The predictions of each model are combined to produce the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stacking: This method involves training multiple different models and using their predictions as input to a higher-level model that learns how to combine them optimally. Stacking can be used to leverage the strengths of different types of models.\n",

    "Bagging (short for Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble technique in machine learning that involves training multiple instances of the same model on different subsets of the training data and then combining their predictions to make a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind bagging is to reduce the variance of a single model by averaging out the predictions of multiple models trained on different subsets of the data. Each model in the ensemble is trained on a randomly sampled subset of the training data, with replacement. This means that some examples may appear multiple times in the same subset, while others may not appear at all. By sampling with replacement, we can create multiple different subsets of the data that are representative of the overall training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the models have been trained on their respective subsets of the training data, they are used to make predictions on the test data. The final prediction is then obtained by aggregating the predictions of all the models, usually by taking the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging can be used with any type of model, including decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines. It is particularly effective with models that are prone to overfitting, as it can help to reduce the variance of the model and improve its generalization performance."

This allows the weak models to focus on the examples that are most important for improving the overall prediction.\n",
